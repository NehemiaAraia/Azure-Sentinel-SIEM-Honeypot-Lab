# Azure-Sentinel-SIEM-Honeypot-Lab
Deployed a honeypot within Microsoft Azure to simulate vulnerabilities and capture attack logs, which I then analyzed using Azure Sentinel as my SIEM solution. implemented the SIEM by configuring Azure resources, which includes virtual machines and Log Analytics Workspaces and used Kusto Query Language (KQL) for log querying. Lastly, I created an interactive world map dashboard to visualize attack patterns and geolocation data.
